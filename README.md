# Mathematics in Biology

This is a public repository for supplementary materials to the book "Mathematics in Biology", by Markus Meister, Ruben Portugues, and Kyu Hyun Lee.

## Figures
Almost all figures in the book are drawn programmatically. 

The resulting PDF files are in the directory `figs/`.

The python code that produced them is in the Jupyter notebooks `Figures_Ch_XX.ipynb`. 

The directory `data/` contains files needed to produce some of the figures.

## Solutions
Solutions to some of the exercises are in the directory `solutions/`.

To submit a solution that we may display here (with author credit of course), please send it in form of a Jupyter notebook to `contact@mathinbio.com`.
